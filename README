NAME

PerlIO::bitswap - I/O layer to swap bits and bytes

DESCRIPTION

This PerlIO layer swaps the order of bits, nybbles, or bytes within
bytes or words.  It is a convenience when working with a file that uses
a different endianness from the program, or when some other part of the
system applies unwanted swaps.
